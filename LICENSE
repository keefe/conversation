This project contains two projects, which will be split into two different open source projects under different licenses. 
One is GPL licensed, which is just a GPL wordpress compatible template set. 
The other is the core product and most of its templates. These are going to be Berkeley license probably
That project will eventually evolve to have closed source plugins
the few GPL experiments underway typically have a license as such in their directory
these specific things may very well just be abandoned altogether anyway
